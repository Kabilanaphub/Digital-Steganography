Digital Steganography Using Java

Introduction

In an era where data security is a critical concern, safeguarding sensitive information from cyber threats has become a necessity. Digital steganography provides an innovative solution by concealing confidential data within digital files such as text, images, and handwritten documents. Unlike traditional encryption methods that alter the data format, steganography ensures a higher level of security by embedding the information discreetly, making it virtually undetectable. This approach enhances privacy, maintains data integrity, and fortifies defenses against cyber threats.

Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore, understand, and implement steganography techniques for securing user data. By leveraging steganographic methods, we aim to develop an application capable of hiding sensitive information within text, images, and handwritten content. Our solution ensures that data remains concealed in plain sight while incorporating encryption and steganographic algorithms to enhance security.

Features

- --->Text Steganography: Embeds sensitive messages within text files while maintaining readability.

- --->Image Steganography: Conceals information within image files without visible distortion.

- --->Handwritten Text Steganography: Integrates handwritten text analysis to encode hidden messages.

- --->Encryption Mechanisms: Enhances security by encrypting the embedded data before concealing it.

- --->User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive platform for users to encode and decode hidden messages effortlessly.

- --->Robust Data Protection: Ensures data confidentiality and integrity against unauthorized access and cyber threats.
